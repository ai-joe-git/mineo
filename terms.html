You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
                
                <h2 id="products">3. Products and Services</h2>

                <p>Risk of loss and title for items purchased from our website pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. It is your responsibility to file any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.</p>
                
                <h2 id="warranty">6. Product Warranty</h2>
                <p>The MINEO LivAI26 and other MINEO hardware products come with a limited warranty as specified in the product documentation or on our website. Generally, our hardware products are warranted to be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of two (2) years from the date of delivery.</p>
                <p>The warranty does not cover damage caused by misuse, abuse, accidents, unauthorized service or modification, or normal wear and tear. Software and services provided by MINEO are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.</p>
                <p>To make a warranty claim, contact our customer support with proof of purchase and a description of the defect. We will either repair or replace the defective product, or provide a refund at our discretion.</p>
                
                <h2 id="returns">7. Returns and Refunds</h2>

                <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unopened and unused, with all original packaging and documentation. You must also provide proof of purchase.</p>
                <p>To initiate a return, contact our customer support to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number. Items returned without an RMA number may not be accepted.</p>
                <p>Refunds will be processed using the original payment method. Processing times for refunds vary depending on the payment method.</p>
                <p>Pre-orders may be canceled for a full refund before the product has shipped. Once the product has shipped, our standard return policy applies.</p>
